This readme contains the steps to build SuperLU_4.3_b as installed in

/projects/albany/gcc-10.1.0

Source is at

/projects/albany/src/SuperLU_4.3_b

1. Copy the "SuperLU-4.3_b_make.inc" to "make.inc" in the SuperLU source directory.

2. Need to manually make install paths for the software or the build will fail:

  mkdir /projects/albany/gcc-10.1.0/SuperLU_4.3
  mkdir /projects/albany/gcc-10.1.0/SuperLU_4.3/include
  mkdir /projects/albany/gcc-10.1.0/SuperLU_4.3/lib

3. make (do not use parallel make or the build might fail)

  Note: make builds the library "in place" so there is not an install step.

4. Need to manually install the headers
  cd SRC
  cp *.h /projects/albany/gcc-10.1.0/SuperLU_4.3/include
